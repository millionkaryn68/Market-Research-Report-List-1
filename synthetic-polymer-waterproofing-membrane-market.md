<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Synthetic Polymer Waterproofing Membrane Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sheet Based Waterproofing Membrane</li><li>Liquid Applied Membranes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The synthetic polymer waterproofing membrane market comprises two main types: sheet-based waterproofing membranes and liquid-applied membranes. Sheet-based membranes are pre-manufactured rolls that provide a reliable barrier against water intrusion, often used in roofing and below-grade applications due to their durability and ease of installation. Liquid-applied membranes, on the other hand, are applied directly to surfaces as a liquid, creating a seamless, flexible barrier that conforms to complex shapes and details, making them ideal for irregular surfaces and intricate installations.</p></p>
