<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Peditrics Orthoses Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Helmets</li><li>Passive Helmets</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The pediatrics orthoses market includes two main types of helmets: active and passive. Active helmets are designed to actively promote skull shape correction through dynamic adjustments that encourage proper cranial growth. In contrast, passive helmets provide a static framework that primarily supports the head without facilitating motion. Both types are used to treat conditions like plagiocephaly, with active helmets often offering a more interactive approach, while passive helmets are typically more straightforward in their application and function.</p></p>
