<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Car Exhaust System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Exhaust System</li><li>Dual Exhaust System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The car exhaust system market includes single and dual exhaust systems. A single exhaust system uses one pipe to expel gases, offering cost-effectiveness and simplicity, ideal for standard vehicles. Dual exhaust systems feature two pipes, enhancing performance by reducing backpressure, improving engine efficiency, and producing a deeper sound, often preferred in high-performance or luxury cars. Both systems aim to manage emissions and noise, but dual systems cater to power and aesthetic demands, while single systems prioritize affordability and practicality.</p></p>
