<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Smart Hybrid Vehicle Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Belt-integrated Starter Generator</li><li>Crankshaft-integrated Motor Generator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The smart hybrid vehicle market includes two primary types of integrated systems: belt-integrated starter generators (BISGs) and crankshaft-integrated motor generators (CIMGs). BISGs use a belt-driven mechanism to assist the internal combustion engine during acceleration and enable regenerative braking, enhancing fuel efficiency. In contrast, CIMGs are directly connected to the crankshaft, providing a more compact design with improved power delivery and efficiency. Both technologies aim to optimize hybrid vehicle performance, reduce emissions, and promote sustainable driving solutions.</p></p>
